		<p>HANDING MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER
All cash transactions must be visible to the security cameras, so always place your cash on the layout outside of your betting spot, and then tell the dealer what denomination chips you want.</p>
      <p>HOLDING THE CARDS WITH TWO HANDS
        In games where the cards are dealt face down, usually single- and double-deck games, be sure to pick up the cards with one hand, not two.        </p>
      <p>TOUCHING THE CARDS
        When four or more decks of cards are used, they are usually dealt face up to each player from a dealing shoe. The reason the cards are dealt face up is two-fold. First, it eliminates the potential for player cheating by either marking or switching the cards, and second, it speeds up the game, because the dealer can quickly announce the total of each player’s hand. There is no reason to touch the cards, so don’t do it.        </p>
      <p>REMOVING THE CARDS FROM THE TABLE
        The cards in your hand must always be in full view of the dealer and the security cameras. Therefore, you should never, for example, hold them in your lap or below the level of the table.</p>

      <p>PLACING OBJECTS ON THE TABLE:-
Purses, wallets, bags, and other items should be placed on your person or next to you, except ladies’ purses, which should be held in the lap. It’s OK to have a drink on the table, but use the drink holders provided by the casino to avoid spilling anything on the layout.</p>
      <p>TOUCHING YOUR CHIPS AFTER YOU’VE MADE YOUR BET AND THE CARDS ARE DEALT:-
        Your original bet must stay on the layout untouched until it either wins, loses, or ties. Once the dealer starts dealing the cards, that’s your cue to not touch your chips until the hand is resolved.        </p>
      <p>TELLING THE DEALER THAT YOU WANT A “HIT.”:-
        Saying, “Hit me” might be OK when playing blackjack with friends on the kitchen table, but in the casinos, it won’t fly. For security reasons, you must always use hand signals, not words to signify to the dealer how you want to play your hand. In many casinos an “eye in the sky” camera is used to record the hand gestures of players for security reasons. If your hand gestures do not match what you say, it can be considered duplicitous or deliberately misleading, so stick to hand signals not words.        </p>
      <p>PLACING A HIGHER DENOMINATION CHIP ON TOP OF A LOWER DENOMINATION CHIP IN YOUR BETTING SPOT:- If you are wagering two or more different denomination chips, always place the higher denomination chip on the bottom of the stack. </p>
